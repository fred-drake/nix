# Container Update Report

Update container digests and deploy affected NixOS hosts end-to-end.

## Workflow

### 1. Update Container Digests

Run the update command to fetch latest container SHAs:

```bash
just update-container-digests
```

This updates `apps/fetcher/containers-sha.nix` with the latest digests from all registries.

### 2. Check What Changed

Check the diff to see which containers have updates:

```bash
git diff apps/fetcher/containers-sha.nix
```

Summarize changes in a table format:
- Registry (docker.io, ghcr.io, lscr.io, etc.)
- Container name and tag
- Note: If no changes, inform user that all containers are up to date

### 3. Map Containers to Hosts

Search for container usage in `.nix` files:

```bash
# Search for specific container
grep -r "container-name" --include="*.nix" .
```

Key locations:
- `apps/*.nix` - Application definitions
- `modules/nixos/host/*/` - Host-specific configurations

See [container-host-mapping.md](references/container-host-mapping.md) for known mappings.

### 4. Deploy Affected Hosts

Ask user which hosts to deploy, then deploy each:

```bash
just colmena <hostname>
```

Run deployments in parallel when hosts are independent. Verify success by checking output shows "Activation successful" and "All done!".

### 5. Report Summary

After deployment, provide a summary table:

| Container | Host | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| container:tag | hostname | ✓ |

## Common Container Locations

| Container | Typical Host |
|-----------|--------------|
| postgres | woodpecker, paperless, sonarqube, resume |
| redis | paperless |
| woodpecker-agent/server | woodpecker |
| n8n | n8n |
| calibre, sabnzbd, sonarr, radarr | larussa |
| kavita, lazylibrarian | kavita, larussa |
| paperless-ngx | paperless |
