UPDATE the PLANNING.md file with context that is currently relevant to the project.  Walk through each line to confirm that the information is still valid.  REMOVE or UPDATE stale information.
THEN UPDATE the TASK.md file, marking tasks completed if we have finished them, and adding new tasks if we are accomplishing something that is not on the task list.  Prioritize the tasks based on importance.
