Using the product-owner-analyzer sub agent and the gitea-product-owner MCP server, analyze issue #$ARGUMENTS from the gitea issues.

Based on your analysis of the issue:
- If the issue needs clarification, ask specific questions to better understand the requirements
- If the issue is clear enough, write user stories following the format "As a [user type], I want [functionality], so that [benefit]"
- If there are non-technical questions about the product or feature, provide clear answers from a product perspective

Focus on understanding the business value, user needs, and acceptance criteria rather than implementation details.

If you are replying with anything, add a reply to the gitea issue directly.
