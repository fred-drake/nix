OBJECTIVE: Debug and resolve the error from the terminal command.

PROCESS:
1. DIAGNOSE the error:
   - Read the full error message and stack trace
   - Identify the specific file, line number, and error type
   - Note any error codes or specific failure reasons

2. RESEARCH the solution:
   - Use `context7` to examine relevant code and configuration files
   - Search web if needed for error messages, especially for framework-specific or dependency issues
   - Check for common causes: syntax errors, missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, type mismatches

3. IMPLEMENT the fix:
   - Make the minimal necessary changes to resolve the issue
   - Preserve existing functionality while fixing the error
   - Add comments if the fix addresses a non-obvious issue

4. VERIFY the fix:
   - Re-run the original command
   - If new errors appear, repeat this process
   - If successful, verify no functionality was broken

PRIORITIES:
- Fix root causes, not symptoms
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over complex workarounds
- Maintain code quality and consistency with the existing codebase
