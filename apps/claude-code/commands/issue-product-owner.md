# Product Owner Strategic Analysis

## OBJECTIVE
Analyze a Gitea issue thread from a product perspective and craft a strategic response that balances user needs, business value, and technical feasibility.

## Initial Setup

### Parse Arguments
```
ISSUE_NUMBER = #$ARGUMENTS  # The Gitea issue number to analyze
```

### Required Tools
- `product-owner-analyzer` sub-agent: For product strategy and prioritization
- `gitea-product-owner` MCP server: For fetching issue data and context

## Phase 1: Comprehensive Issue Analysis

### 1. Fetch Complete Context
Using `gitea-product-owner` MCP server, retrieve:
- Original issue description and all comments
- Issue metadata (labels, milestone, priority, assignees)
- Related issues and dependencies
- Historical context (previous related discussions)
- Project roadmap alignment

### 2. Stakeholder Analysis
Map all participants and their perspectives:
- **End Users**: Pain points, use cases, feature requests
- **Engineering Team**: Technical concerns, implementation complexity
- **Business Stakeholders**: ROI, market positioning, competitive advantage
- **Support Team**: Customer feedback, common issues
- **QA/Security**: Risk factors, compliance requirements

### 3. Requirement Classification
Categorize all expressed needs:
- **User Stories**: Who needs what and why
- **Business Goals**: Revenue, retention, market share impact
- **Technical Debt**: Infrastructure, performance, maintainability
- **Compliance/Security**: Regulatory or security requirements
- **Nice-to-Haves**: Enhancements that add polish

## Phase 2: Strategic Analysis ("Ultrathinking")

### 1. User Impact Assessment
- **User Segments Affected**: Identify which user groups benefit
- **Pain Point Severity**: Rate from critical blocker to minor inconvenience
- **Usage Frequency**: How often users encounter this scenario
- **Workaround Availability**: Can users achieve goals another way?
- **User Satisfaction Impact**: Effect on NPS/CSAT scores

### 2. Business Value Analysis
- **Revenue Impact**: Direct or indirect revenue implications
- **Market Differentiation**: Competitive advantage gained
- **Strategic Alignment**: Fit with product vision and roadmap
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Development cost vs. expected value
- **Opportunity Cost**: What we can't do if we do this

### 3. Technical Feasibility Review
- **Complexity Assessment**: Simple fix vs. architectural change
- **Risk Evaluation**: Potential for regression or system impact
- **Dependency Analysis**: Prerequisites and blockers
- **Resource Requirements**: Team expertise and availability
- **Timeline Implications**: Impact on other commitments

### 4. Prioritization Framework
Apply prioritization matrix:
- **Impact**: (High/Medium/Low) - User and business value
- **Effort**: (High/Medium/Low) - Technical complexity
- **Urgency**: (Critical/Important/Nice-to-have)
- **Strategic Fit**: (Core/Adjacent/Experimental)

## Phase 3: Solution Synthesis

### Decision Framework
Based on analysis, determine the response approach:

1. **PROCEED** - High value, feasible, aligned with strategy
2. **MODIFY** - Good idea but needs scoping/adjustment
3. **DEFER** - Valid but not now (specify when/why)
4. **DECLINE** - Doesn't align with product direction
5. **INVESTIGATE** - Need more data before deciding
