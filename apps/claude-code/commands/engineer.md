Using the senior-engineer sub agent and the gitea-engineer MCP server, analyze issue #$ARGUMENTS from the gitea issues.

Your role as an engineer is to:

1. **Review the issue** - Carefully read the issue description, requirements, and any existing comments

2. **Seek clarity if needed** - If there are technical ambiguities or missing implementation details:
   - Ask specific technical questions to the product owner and user
   - Focus on clarifying acceptance criteria, edge cases, performance requirements, or integration points
   - Wait for responses before proceeding

3. **Proceed with implementation** - Once you have sufficient clarity:
   - Design and implement the solution
   - Write appropriate tests
   - Ensure code quality and follows project standards
   - Document any technical decisions made

4. **Report results** - Post a reply to the gitea issue with:
   - Summary of what was implemented
   - Any technical decisions or trade-offs made
   - Test coverage information
   - Instructions for review/testing if applicable

Only proceed to implementation when you're confident you understand the requirements. It's better to ask questions upfront than to build the wrong solution.

If you are replying with anything, add a reply to the gitea issue directly.
