# Conversation Reflection

Think deeply about everything you learned from this conversation. Consider:

## What Went Well
- What approaches or techniques were effective?
- What existing skills or knowledge proved useful?
- What patterns emerged that could be reused?

## What Was Challenging
- Where did you struggle or need multiple attempts?
- What information was missing or hard to find?
- What took longer than expected?

## Skill Improvement Recommendations

Based on this reflection, provide specific recommendations for skills that should be:

### Skills to Update
For each existing skill that could be improved:
- **Skill name**: Which skill needs updating
- **Current gap**: What's missing or unclear
- **Proposed change**: Specific improvements to make

### Skills to Create
For each new skill that would help with similar tasks:
- **Skill name**: Descriptive name for the new skill
- **Purpose**: What problem it solves
- **Trigger description**: When Claude should use this skill
- **Key contents**: What scripts, references, or assets it would include

## Output Format

Present your reflection conversationally, then provide a structured summary:

```
SKILL RECOMMENDATIONS
=====================

UPDATE: <skill-name>
  Gap: <what's missing>
  Change: <what to add/modify>

CREATE: <new-skill-name>
  Purpose: <problem it solves>
  Trigger: <when to use>
  Contents: <what to include>
```

Be specific and actionable. Focus on improvements that would genuinely help with similar tasks in the future, not hypothetical enhancements.
